Hello there! Welcome to my new portfolio. This is your chance to get your last-minute savior bento-styled portfolio!

This project was kick-started with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), and I'm diving back into React after a good long break. So, ðŸš¨ **please don't hate me if things look a bit rusty!** There's plenty of room for improvement, and I'm all ears for any suggestions.
